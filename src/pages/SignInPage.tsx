JJ sits down with his parents: his dad, DR. SHERWIN JAMSHIDI (50s, distinguished and charming) and his mom DR. VANESSA JAMSHIDI (50s, ageless beauty with superhuman discipline). A WAITER is taking their order.

SHERWIN: I'll have the steak, medium rare. And when I say medium-rare, I mean between rare and medium. Pink-ish, not freshly slaughtered.

JJ: Dad, I think he gets it.

SHERWIN: Better to be specific.

VANESSA: The kale salad for me, no pecorino, no croutons, dressing on the side. Thank you.

JJ: Just coffee for me, thanks.

VANESSA: Are you sure, honey? You're looking quite thin. (to the waiter) He'll have the steak, too.

JJ: Mom!

But the waiter nods and takes off.

JJ: I can't stay long. I have track practice.

VANESSA: Well, then you need protein. I can't have my son running around on an empty stomach.

JJ: I'm fine, mom. Do you know I take care of myself 10 months out of the year without you guys, right?

SHERWIN: And look what happens to you when you're left to your own devices. Malnourished and failing biology.

JJ: And here I was worried that you two would be dramatic. (then) It was a C! One time! And I pulled my grade back up with extra credit.

VANESSA: There's no need to shout, Julian.

JJ: I'm notâ€” (gives up) Sorry. It's just -- some parents might be happy that their son got a full ride to UVA. It's a great school, you know.

VANESSA: Of course we are thrilled about that, honey. It has a great pre-med program -- in fact, we should set you up with some of our former colleagues in Virginia. Ken Andersen still runs the cardiology department over there, doesn't he, Sherwin?

SHERWIN: I think he does. But I always saw Julian as more of an orthopedic surgery kind of man, don't you think?

VANESSA: That does tie in with his athletic interests. You know what they say, they're the jocks of the medical field.

Sherwin chuckles. JJ's growing frustration goes unnoticed (or ignored) by both his parents. They look up as he stands.

JJ: I think I might actually be an impediment to this conversation, so, I'm gonna go.

VANESSA: Oh -- you are so sensitive. Sit down. We're going to have a lovely lunch with our son who we never get to see.

JJ hesitates. Then sits back down. Vanessa smiles and pats him on the shoulder.

VANESSA: Now, tell us more about this boyfriend of yours. Is he a good student?

Off JJ, another parental battle lost.`;
